Unlocking the Mysteries of Neurons: A Computational Model for Education and Research

Understanding the properties of a single neuron is fundamental to mastering neuroscience. However, conveying this knowledge through traditional methods—notes, one-on-one mentoring, and neurophysiological labs—can be challenging. Realistically, it’s not always feasible to provide every student with hands-on neurophysiological experiences that effectively demonstrate how complex neuronal circuits operate.
That’s where computational neuroscience comes in. By modeling neuronal systems, we can bridge this gap, providing both students and researchers with powerful tools to learn, experiment, and advance our understanding of the brain. In fact, combining theoretical models with experimental work has already shown that rodent neurons cannot be directly equated to human neurons when it comes to computational properties.
As part of my ongoing commitment to neuroscience education, I’ve developed a biorealistic model of a human L2/3 cortical neuron in the NEURON simulation environment. This model allows users to manipulate ionic properties, spine density, and the activation of synaptic receptors (AMPA and NMDA), and then observe how these factors influence neuronal firing.
What makes this model truly unique is its ability to simulate changes in synaptic mechanisms—like those seen in epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders—by allowing users to add or subtract spines at will on any segment of the neuron. The result? A dynamic, hands-on learning experience where users can interactively see the impact of their changes in real time, making it an invaluable tool for both teaching and cutting-edge research.
With changes in spine density and synaptic mechanisms often going unnoticed in experimental settings due to the difficulty of obtaining fresh tissue, this model offers a rare opportunity to study the effects of these changes in a controlled, reproducible manner. This opens up new avenues for research, especially in understanding diseases that alter synaptic structures and neuronal behavior.
Whether you're a student eager to explore the dynamics of neurons or a researcher looking to test new hypotheses, this model provides a unique, practical tool to further our understanding of the brain.
